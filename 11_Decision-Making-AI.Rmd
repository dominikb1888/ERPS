## Machine Learning Helps Akershus University Hospital Make Better Treatment Decisions

* Problem
  * Unstructured data
  * Very large volume of data
  * Opportunities from new technology
  
* Solutions
  * IBM Watson Explorer
  * Machine learning
  * Natural language processing
* Illustrates how information systems improve decision-making

---

## Business Value of Improved Decision Making

* Possible to measure value of improved decision making
* Decisions made at all levels of the firm
  * Some are common, routine, and numerous
  * Although value of improving any single decision may be small, improving hundreds of thousands of “small” decisions adds up to large annual value for the business

---

## Table 11.1 Business Value of Enhanced Decision Making

---

## Types of Decisions

* Unstructured
  * Decision maker must provide judgment to solve problem
  * Novel, important, nonroutine
  * No well-understood or agreed-upon procedure for making them
* Structured
  * Repetitive and routine
  * Involve definite procedure for handling them so do not have to be treated as new
* Semi-structured
  * Only part of problem has clear-cut answer provided by accepted procedure
