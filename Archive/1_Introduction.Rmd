## Enterprises - What is you perspective on Organization?

- What is organized? Organized == Ordered?
- How can you enforce coordinated action?
- Information only? 
- Leadership + Real-time Information (True Agility)

## Planning - How are we supposed to know what we did until we did it?

- Switch from a producer to a consumer-centric industrial production
- From:  Mass Custumization, 3D-Printing, Industry 4.0
- To: Hyperpersonlization and Servitization




---

## Wrap-up

- ERP-Systems put strict models on current sitations 
- Reasonable in particular "Standard Processes"
- However, less and less "STandard Processes" more Agility
- Less Orders, More Discourse

## Jobs

1\-3 Why are MIS\-related jobs in high demand?

74 percent of CEOs plan to use artificial intelligence \(AI\) to automate tasks to a large or very large extent over the next 3 years.

Those same CEOs believe just 26 percent of their workers are prepared to collaborate with their AI coworkers.

Just 3 percent of CEOs plan to increase investments toward training and reskilling employees to prepare them for these new tech\-centric jobs.

Understanding technology and having a willingness to learn new tech skills will be increasingly important for future job security.
