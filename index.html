## Enterprises - What is you perspective on Organization?

- What is organized? Organized == Ordered?
- How can you enforce coordinated action?
- Information only? 
- Leadership + Real-time Information (True Agility)

## Resources - What is and what will be valuable

## Planning 
#### How are we supposed to know what we did until we did it?

- Switch from a producer to a consumer-centric industrial production
- From:  Mass Custumization, 3D-Printing, Industry 4.0
- To: Hyperpersonlization and Servitization




---

## Wrap-up

- ERP-Systems put strict models on current sitations 
- Reasonable in particular "Standard Processes"
- However, less and less "Standard Processes" more Agility
- Less Orders, More Discourse

In our current environment the key challenges for Management Information Systems are in coping with new technologies, (performance) Management, and organizing IT Systems. Due to the rapid and somewhat forced virtualization of all enterprises these are almost identical to General Management Challenges. The question arises if there is a substantial difference between General and IS Management at the moment and also in the future.

## Globalization Challenges and Opportunities: A Flattened World

Internet and global communications have greatly reduced economic and cultural advantages of developed countries.

  - Drastic reduction of costs of operating and transacting on global scale
  - Competition for jobs, markets, resources, ideas
  - Dependence on imports and exports
  - Requires new understandings of skills, markets, opportunities

## Business Drivers of Information Systems

Businesses invest in IT to achieve six important business objectives.

- Operational excellence
- New products, services, and business models
- Customer and supplier intimacy
- Improved decision making
- Competitive advantage
- Survival


---

## Operational Excellence

* Improved efficiency results in higher profits.
* Information systems and technologies help improve efficiency and productivity.
* Example: Walmart
  * Power of combining information systems and best business practices to achieve operational efficiency—and over $514 billion in sales in 2019
  * Most efficient retail store in world as result of digital links between suppliers and stores

---

## New Products, Services, and Business Models

&lt;!-- TODO Apple Business Model --&gt;

???

* Information systems and technologies enable firms to create new products, services, and business models.
* Business model: how a company produces, delivers, and sells its products and services
* Example: Apple
  * Transformed old model of music distribution with iTunes
  * Constant innovations—iPod,iPhone,iPad, etc.

---

## Customer and Supplier Intimacy

* Customers who are served well become repeat customers who purchase more.
  * Mandarin Oriental Hotel uses IT to foster an intimate relationship with its customers, keeping track of preferences, and so on
* Close relationships with suppliers result in lower costs.
  * JCPenney
    * IT to enhance relationship with supplier in Hong Kong

---

## Improved Decision Making

If managers rely on forecasts, best guesses, and luck, they will misallocate employees, services, and inventory.

Real-time data improves ability of managers to make decisions.

Verizon: web-based digital dashboard to update managers with real-time data on customer complaints, network performance, and line outages

---

## Competitive Advantage

* Often results from achieving previous business objectives
* Advantages over competitors:
  * Charging less for superior products, better performance, and better response to suppliers and customers
  * Examples: Apple, Walmart, andU P Sare industry leaders because they know how to use information systems for this purpose

---

## Survival

* Businesses may need to invest in information systems out of necessity; it is simply the cost of doing business.
* Keeping up with competitors
  * Citibank’s introduction ofA T Ms
* Federal and state regulations and reporting requirements
  * Toxic Substances Control Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

---

# What Is an Information System?

* Information technology: the hardware and software a business uses to achieve objectives
* Information system: interrelated components that manage information to:
  * Support decision making and control
  * Help with analysis, visualization, and product creation
* Data: streams of raw facts
* Information: data shaped into meaningful, useful form

* Activities in an information system that produce information:
  * Input
  * Processing
  * Output
  * Feedback
  
* Sharp distinction between __computer__ or __computer program__ versus __information system__

# A Problem-solving Mindset

* Few business problems are simple or straightforward.
* Most business problems involve a number of major factors that can fall into three main categories:
  * Organization
  * Technology
  * People

---

## A Model of the Problem-Solving Approach

Problem solving: four-step process
  * Problem identification
  * Solution design
  * Choice
  * Implementation

---

## Problem identification includes:
  * Agreement that problem exists
  * Definition of problem
  * Causes of problem
  * What can be done given resources of firm
  
---

## Typical organizational problems

  * Outdated business processes
  * Unsupportive culture and attitudes
  * Political in-fighting
  * Turbulent business environment, change
  * Complexity of task
  * Inadequate resources
  
---

## Typical technology problems

  * Insufficient or aging hardware
  * Outdated software
  * Inadequate database capacity
  * Insufficient telecommunications capacity
  * Incompatibility of old systems with new technology
  * Rapid technological change

---

## Typical people problems
  * Lack of employee training
  * Difficulties of evaluating performance
  * Legal and regulatory compliance
  * Work environment, ergonomics
  * Poor or indecisive management
  * Lack of employee support and participation


---
## Solution design
  * Often many possible solutions
  * Consider as many as possible to understand range of solutions

---
## Solution Evaluation and Choice – factors include:
  * Cost
  * Feasibility given resources and skills
  * Length of time needed to implement solution


---
## Implementation
  * Building or purchasing solution
  * Testing solution, employee training
  * Change management
  * Measurement of outcomes
  * Feedback, evaluation of solution
* Problem solving is a continuous process, not a single event
  * Sometimes chosen solution doesn’t work or needs adjustment

---

## Figure 1.4 Problem Solving Is a Continuous Four-Step Process

![](img/laudon_emis14_ppt_ch01_MS-ct4.jpg)

---

## The Role of Critical Thinking in Problem Solving (1 of 2)

* Without critical thinking, easy to jump to conclusions, misjudge a problem, and waste resources
* Critical thinking:
  * Sustained suspension of judgment with an awareness of multiple perspectives and alternatives
  * Ability to collect and analyze data that might help understand the nature of the problem; a “data driven” approach

* Four elements of critical thinking:
  * Maintaining doubt and suspending judgment
  * Being aware of different perspectives

    * Including technology, organization, and people perspectives
  * Testing alternatives and letting experience guide
  * Being aware of organizational and personal limitations

---

## The Connections Among Business Objectives, Problems, and Solutions

When firms cannot achieve business objectives these objectives become challenges.

Information systems often present solutions, partially or fully, to these challenges.

---

## How Information Systems Will Affect Business Careers

- Success in today’s job market requires a broad set of skills.

# CLASS DISCUSSION: The Future of Work

---

## Digital Companies employ new forms of Organizing

[VALVE Handbook for new Employees](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)

&gt; Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and
repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to
control a large group of people from the top down, which
is why military organizations rely on it so heavily.
But when you’re an entertainment company that’s spent
the last decade going out of its way to recruit the most
intelligent, innovative, talented people on Earth, telling
them to sit at a desk and do what they’re told obliterates
99 percent of their value. 

&gt; We want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where they’ll flourish.
That’s why Valve is flat. It’s our shorthand way of saying
that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports
to” anybody else. We do have a founder/president, but
even he isn’t your manager. This company is yours to
steer—toward opportunities and away from risks. You have
the power to green-light projects. You have the power to
ship products. 

![[VALVE Logo]](img/1280px-Valve_logo.svg.png)

    * Minimizes inventory at warehouses, operating costs
    * Efficient customer response system

* Product differentiation
  * Use information systems to enable new products and services, or greatly change the customer convenience in using your existing products and services
  * E.g., Google's continuous innovations, Apple'si Phone
  * Use information systems to customize, personalize products to fit specifications of individual consumers
    * E.g., Nike's NIKEi Dprogram for customized sneakers

* Focus on market niche
  * Use information systems to enable specific market focus, and serve narrow target market better than competitors.
    * Analyzes customer buying habits, preferences
    * Advertising pitches to smaller and smaller target markets
  * E.g., Hilton Hotel’sOn QSystem
    * Analyzes data collected on guests to determine preferences and guest's profitability

* Strengthen customer and supplier intimacy.
  * Strong linkages to customers and suppliers increase switching costs and loyalty
  * Toyota: usesI Sto facilitate direct access from suppliers to production schedules
    * Permits suppliers to decide how and when to ship supplies to plants, allowing more lead time in producing goods
  * Amazon: keeps track of user preferences for purchases, and recommends titles purchased by others

---

## The Internet’s Impact on Competitive Advantage

- Enables new products and services
- Encourages substitute products
- Lowers barrier to entry

---

## The Value Web

* A firm’s value chain is linked to the value chains of its suppliers, distributors, and customers.
* Value web
  * Collection of independent firms that use information technology to coordinate their value chains to produce a product collectively
  * Value webs are flexible and adapt to changes in supply and demand

---

## Figure 3.3 The Value Web

&lt;img src="img/laudon_emis14_ppt_ch03_MS-ct3.jpg" width=500px /&gt;

## Synergies, Core Competencies, and Network-Based Strategies

* Large corporations comprised of business units
  * Financial returns overall are tied to performance of business units
* Information systems improve performance of business units by promoting
  * Communication
  * Synergies (Revenue, Cost, Financial)
  * Core competencies, Dynamic Capabilities

---

## Synergies

# Types of Synergies

- Revenue
- Cost
- Financial


# Examples

- When output of some businessunits can be used as inputs to other units
- When two firms can pool markets and expertise (e.g., recent bank mergers) to lower costs and generate profits
- Enabled by information systems that ties together disparate units so they act as whole

???



---

## Core Competency

* Activities for which firm is world-class leader
  * E.g., world’s best miniature parts designer, best package delivery service, etc
* Relies on knowledge gained over years of experience as well as knowledge research
* Any information system that encourages the sharing of knowledge across business units enhances competency
  * E.g., Procter &amp; Gamble uses intranet to help people working on similar problems share ideas and expertise.

---

## Network-Based Strategies

* Network economics
  * Marginal costs of adding another participant are near zero, whereas marginal gain is much larger
  * E.g., larger number of participants in Internet, greater value to all participants
* Virtual company
  * Uses networks to link people, resources, and ally with other companies to create and distribute products without traditional organizational boundaries or physical locations

---

## Disruptive Technologies

* Technologies with disruptive impact on industries and businesses, rendering existing products, services and business models obsolete
  * Personal computers
  * World Wide Web
  * Internet music services
* First movers versus fast followers
  * First movers of disruptive technologies may fail to see potential, allowing second movers to reap rewards (fast followers)

---

## The Internet and Globalization

* Prior to the Internet, competing globally was only an option for huge firms able to afford factories, warehouses, and distribution centers abroad.
* The Internet drastically reduces costs of operating globally.
* Globalization benefits
  * Scale economies and resource cost reduction
  * Higher utilization rates, fixed capital costs, and lower cost per unit of production
  * Speeding time to market

# The Basic Concepts of Ethics

---

## Basic Concepts: Responsibility, Accountability, and Liability

* Responsibility
  * Accepting the potential costs, duties, and obligations for decisions
* Accountability
  * Mechanisms for identifying responsible parties
* Liability
  * Permits individuals (and firms) to recover damages done to them
* Due process
  * Laws are well-known and understood, with an ability to appeal to higher authorities

---

## Ethical Analysis

* Five-step process for ethical analysis
  * Identify and clearly describe the facts.
  * Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values involved.
  * Identify the stakeholders.
  * Identify the options that you can reasonably take.
  * Identify the potential consequences of your options.

---

## Candidate Ethical Principles

* Golden Rule
  * Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
  
* Immanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative
  * If an action is not right for everyone to take, it is not right for anyone.
  
* Slippery Slope Rule
  * If an action cannot be taken repeatedly, it is not right to take at all.

* Utilitarian Principle
  * Take the action that achieves the higher or greater value.
  
* Risk Aversion Principle
  * Take the action that produces the least harm or potential cost.
  
* Ethical “No Free Lunch” Rule
  * Assume that virtually all tangible and intangible objects are owned by someone unless there is a specific declaration otherwise.

---

## Professional Codes of Conduct

* Promulgated by associations of professionals
  * American Medical Association (AMA)
  * American Bar Association (ABA)
  * Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
* Promises by professions to regulate themselves in the general interest of society

# Ethics in the Real World

---

## Real-World Ethical Dilemmas

* One set of interests pitted against another
* Examples
  * Monitoring employees: right of company to maximize productivity of workers versus workers’ desire to use Internet for short personal tasks
  * Facebook monitors users and sells information to advertisers and app developers

---

## Information Rights: Privacy and Freedom in the Internet Age

* Privacy
  * Claim of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or interference from other individuals, organizations, or state; claim to be able to control information about yourself
* In the United States, privacy protected by:
  * First Amendment (freedom of speech and association)
  * Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure)
  * Additional federal statues (e.g., Privacy Act of 1974)

* Fair information practices
  * Set of principles governing the collection and use of information
    * Basis of most U.S. and European privacy laws
  * Used to drive changes in privacy legislation
    * COPPA
    * Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
    * HIPAA

* FTCFIP principles
  * Notice/awareness (core principle)
  * Choice/consent (core principle)
  * Access/participation
  * Security
  * Enforcement

---

## European Directive on Data Protection

## Internet Challenges to Privacy

* Cookies
  * Identify browser and track visits to site
  * Super cookies (Flash cookies)
  
* Web beacons (web bugs)
  * Tiny graphics embedded in emails and web pages
  * Monitor who is reading email message or visiting site
  
* Spyware
  * Surreptitiously installed on user’s computer
  * May transmit user’s keystrokes or display unwanted ads
  
* Google services and behavioral targeting

* The United States allows businesses to gather transaction information and use this for other marketing purposes.

* Opt-out vs. opt-in model

* Online industry promotes self-regulation over privacy legislation.
  * Complex/ambiguous privacy statements
  * Opt-out models selected over opt-in
  * Online “seals” of privacy principles

## Figure 4.3 How Cookies Identify Web Visitors

![](img/laudon_emis14_ppt_ch04_MS-ct3.jpg)

The Web server reads the user's Web browser and determines the operating system, browser name, version number, Internet address, and other information.

The server transmits a tiny text file with user identification information called a cookie, which the user's browser receives and stores on the user's computer.

When the user returns to the Web site, the server requests the contents of any cookie it deposited previously in the user's computer.

The Web server reads the cookie, identifies the visitor, and calls up data on the user.

## Technical Solutions

* Solutions include:
  * Email encryption
  * Anonymity tools
  * Anti-spyware tools
  
* Overall, technical solutions have failed to protect users from being tracked from one site to another
  * Browser features
    * “Private” browsing
    * “Do not track” options

## Property Rights: Intellectual Property

* Intellectual property
  * Tangible and intangible products of the mind created by individuals or corporations
* Protected in four main ways:
  * Copyright
  * Patents
  * Trademarks
  * Trade secret

---

## Challenges to Intellectual Property Rights

* Digital media different from physical media
  * Ease of replication
  * Ease of transmission (networks, Internet)
  * Ease of alteration
  * Compactness
  * Difficulties in establishing uniqueness
* Digital Millennium Copyright Act (D M C A)

## System Quality: Data Quality and System Errors

* What is an acceptable, technologically feasible level of system quality?
  * Flawless software is economically unfeasible
* Three principal sources of poor system performance
  * Software bugs, errors
  * Hardware or facility failures
  * Poor input data quality (most common source of business system failure)

## Quality of Life: Equity, Access, Boundaries

+ Negative social consequences of systems

+ Big tech: Concentrating economic and political power

+ Rapidity of change

+ Maintaining boundaries: family, work and leisure

+ Dependence and vulnerability

* Computer crime and abuse
  * Computer crime
  * Computer abuse
  * Spam
  * CAN-SPAMAct of 2003
  
* Employment
  * Trickle-down technology
  * Reengineering job loss

* Equity and access
  * The digital divide
  
* Health risks
  * Repetitive stress injury (RSI)
  * Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)
  * Computer vision syndrome (CVS)
  * Technostress

## Computer-Related Liability Problems

+ If software fails, who is responsible?
+ If seen as part of a machine that injures or harms, software producer and operator may be liable
+ If seen as similar to book, difficult to hold author/publisher responsible
+ If seen as a service, would this be similar to telephone systems not being liable for transmitted messages?


???

- What is free will and what is reason?

Who should be liable:
- The driver? (Nooo... didn't do anything...)
- The car company?
- The software engineer?
- The car itself?

Guiding Questions:
- Who owns the code and data center
- Where is the code executed?
- How much learning war involved in the process?
- When can we speak about free will?
  - Memories and distributed decision?
  - Did someone tell the car to do it or did it infer that
  -
