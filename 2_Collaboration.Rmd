# CLASS DISCUSSION: The Future of Work

---

## Digital Companies employ new forms of Organizing

[VALVE Handbook for new Employees](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)

> Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and
repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to
control a large group of people from the top down, which
is why military organizations rely on it so heavily.
But when you’re an entertainment company that’s spent
the last decade going out of its way to recruit the most
intelligent, innovative, talented people on Earth, telling
them to sit at a desk and do what they’re told obliterates
99 percent of their value. 

> We want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where they’ll flourish.
That’s why Valve is flat. It’s our shorthand way of saying
that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports
to” anybody else. We do have a founder/president, but
even he isn’t your manager. This company is yours to
steer—toward opportunities and away from risks. You have
the power to green-light projects. You have the power to
ship products.
