## What Is a Database?

* Database:
  * Collection of related files containing records on people, places, or things
* Entity:
  * Generalized category representing person, place, thing
  * E.g., SUPPLIER, PART
* Attributes:
  * Specific characteristics of each entity:
    * SUPPLIER name, address
    * PART description, unit price, supplier

# Relational Databases


---

## Relational Databases

* Organize data into two-dimensional tables (relations) with columns and rows
* One table for each entity:
  * E.g., (CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER, PART, SALES)
  * Fields (columns) store data representing an attribute
  * Rows store data for separate records, or tuples
* Key field: uniquely identifies each record
* Primary key

---

## Figure 6.2 A Relational Database Table

---

## Figure 6.3 The PART Table

---

## Establishing Relationships (1 of 2)

* Entity-relationship diagram
  * Used to clarify table relationships in a relational database
* Relational database tables may have:
  * One-to-one relationship
  * One-to-many relationship
  * Many-to-many relationship
    * Requires “join table” or intersection relation that links the two tables to join information

---

# Database Management Systems (DBMS)



---

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

* Software for creating, storing, organizing, and accessing data from a database
* Separates the logical and physical views of the data
  * Logical view: how end users view data
  * Physical view: how data are actually structured and organized
* Examples: Microsoft Access, DB2, Oracle Database, MicrosoftSQL Server, MySQL

---

## Operations of a Relational DBMS

* Select:
  * Creates a subset of all records meeting stated criteria
* Join:
  * Combines relational tables to present the server with more information than is available from individual tables
* Project:
  * Creates a subset consisting of columns in a table
  * Permits user to create new tables containing only desired information

# Non-Relational Databases

---

## Non-Relational Databases

* “NoSQL”
* Handle large data sets of data that are not easily organized into tables, columns, and rows
* Use more flexible data model
  * Don’t require extensive structuring
* Can manage unstructured data, such as social media and graphics
* E.g. Amazon’s SimpleDB, MetLife’s MongoDB

---

## Cloud Databases and Distributed Databases

* Relational database engines provided by cloud computing services
  * Pricing based on usage
  * Appeal to small or medium-sized businesses
* Amazon Relational Database Service
  * Offers MySQL, MicrosoftSQL Server, Oracle Database engines
* Distributed databases
  * Stored in multiple physical locations
  * Google’s Spanner cloud service

---

## The Challenge of Big Data

* Massive quantities of unstructured and semi-structured data from Internet and more
  * 3Vs: Volume, variety, velocity
  * Petabytes and exabytes
* Big datasets offer more patterns and insights than smaller datasets, e.g.
  * Customer behavior
  * Weather patterns
* Requires new technologies and tools

---

## Interactive Session – The Paradise Papers and Big Data Journalism

* Class Discussion
  * Why was it a challenge to place all the documents from the Paradise Papers in one database?
  * Protecting the identity of a whistleblower or whistleblowers is of vital importance to journalists. Give at least one reason why this is so important.
  * Explain why cooperation between data experts and journalists was vital to the efficient analysis of data.
  * News outlets have been experiencing a severe crisis of profitability. What do you think are the causes of this crisis? What role can big data analytics play in countering it?
