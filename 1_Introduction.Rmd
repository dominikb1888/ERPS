In our current environment the key challenges for Management Information Systems are in coping with new technologies, (performance) Management, and organizing IT Systems. Due to the rapid and somewhat forced virtualization of all enterprises these are almost identical to General Management Challenges. The question arises if there is a substantial difference between General and IS Management at the moment and also in the future.

## Globalization Challenges and Opportunities: A Flattened World

Internet and global communications have greatly reduced economic and cultural advantages of developed countries.

  - Drastic reduction of costs of operating and transacting on global scale
  - Competition for jobs, markets, resources, ideas
  - Dependence on imports and exports
  - Requires new understandings of skills, markets, opportunities

## Business Drivers of Information Systems

Businesses invest in IT to achieve six important business objectives.

- Operational excellence
- New products, services, and business models
- Customer and supplier intimacy
- Improved decision making
- Competitive advantage
- Survival


---

## Operational Excellence

* Improved efficiency results in higher profits.
* Information systems and technologies help improve efficiency and productivity.
* Example: Walmart
  * Power of combining information systems and best business practices to achieve operational efficiency—and over $514 billion in sales in 2019
  * Most efficient retail store in world as result of digital links between suppliers and stores

---

## New Products, Services, and Business Models

<!-- TODO Apple Business Model -->

???

* Information systems and technologies enable firms to create new products, services, and business models.
* Business model: how a company produces, delivers, and sells its products and services
* Example: Apple
  * Transformed old model of music distribution with iTunes
  * Constant innovations—iPod,iPhone,iPad, etc.

---

## Customer and Supplier Intimacy

* Customers who are served well become repeat customers who purchase more.
  * Mandarin Oriental Hotel uses IT to foster an intimate relationship with its customers, keeping track of preferences, and so on
* Close relationships with suppliers result in lower costs.
  * JCPenney
    * IT to enhance relationship with supplier in Hong Kong

---

## Improved Decision Making

If managers rely on forecasts, best guesses, and luck, they will misallocate employees, services, and inventory.

Real-time data improves ability of managers to make decisions.

Verizon: web-based digital dashboard to update managers with real-time data on customer complaints, network performance, and line outages

---

## Competitive Advantage

* Often results from achieving previous business objectives
* Advantages over competitors:
  * Charging less for superior products, better performance, and better response to suppliers and customers
  * Examples: Apple, Walmart, andU P Sare industry leaders because they know how to use information systems for this purpose

---

## Survival

* Businesses may need to invest in information systems out of necessity; it is simply the cost of doing business.
* Keeping up with competitors
  * Citibank’s introduction ofA T Ms
* Federal and state regulations and reporting requirements
  * Toxic Substances Control Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

---

# What Is an Information System?

* Information technology: the hardware and software a business uses to achieve objectives
* Information system: interrelated components that manage information to:
  * Support decision making and control
  * Help with analysis, visualization, and product creation
* Data: streams of raw facts
* Information: data shaped into meaningful, useful form

* Activities in an information system that produce information:
  * Input
  * Processing
  * Output
  * Feedback
  
* Sharp distinction between __computer__ or __computer program__ versus __information system__

  * Issues surrounding development, use, impact of information systems used by managers and employees
  * Focuses on firm performance, productivity, and competitive challenges

## CRITICAL THINKING: <br \> In the Digital Age, do these statements hold true?

### Statement on Organizational Structure
> Coordinate work through structured hierarchy and business processes

### Statement on Management
> Role of managers:
    - Perceive business challenges
    - Set organizational strategy
    - Allocate human and financial resources
    - Creative work: new products, service

# A Problem-solving Mindset

* Few business problems are simple or straightforward.
* Most business problems involve a number of major factors that can fall into three main categories:
  * Organization
  * Technology
  * People

---

## A Model of the Problem-Solving Approach

Problem solving: four-step process
  * Problem identification
  * Solution design
  * Choice
  * Implementation

---

## Problem identification includes:
  * Agreement that problem exists
  * Definition of problem
  * Causes of problem
  * What can be done given resources of firm
  
---

## Typical organizational problems

  * Outdated business processes
  * Unsupportive culture and attitudes
  * Political in-fighting
  * Turbulent business environment, change
  * Complexity of task
  * Inadequate resources
  
---

## Typical technology problems

  * Insufficient or aging hardware
  * Outdated software
  * Inadequate database capacity
  * Insufficient telecommunications capacity
  * Incompatibility of old systems with new technology
  * Rapid technological change

---

## Typical people problems
  * Lack of employee training
  * Difficulties of evaluating performance
  * Legal and regulatory compliance
  * Work environment, ergonomics
  * Poor or indecisive management
  * Lack of employee support and participation


---
## Solution design
  * Often many possible solutions
  * Consider as many as possible to understand range of solutions

---
## Solution Evaluation and Choice – factors include:
  * Cost
  * Feasibility given resources and skills
  * Length of time needed to implement solution


---
## Implementation
  * Building or purchasing solution
  * Testing solution, employee training
  * Change management
  * Measurement of outcomes
  * Feedback, evaluation of solution
* Problem solving is a continuous process, not a single event
  * Sometimes chosen solution doesn’t work or needs adjustment

---

## Figure 1.4 Problem Solving Is a Continuous Four-Step Process

![](img/laudon_emis14_ppt_ch01_MS-ct4.jpg){height=80%, width=80%}

---

## The Role of Critical Thinking in Problem Solving (1 of 2)

* Without critical thinking, easy to jump to conclusions, misjudge a problem, and waste resources
* Critical thinking:
  * Sustained suspension of judgment with an awareness of multiple perspectives and alternatives
  * Ability to collect and analyze data that might help understand the nature of the problem; a “data driven” approach

* Four elements of critical thinking:
  * Maintaining doubt and suspending judgment
  * Being aware of different perspectives

    * Including technology, organization, and people perspectives
  * Testing alternatives and letting experience guide
  * Being aware of organizational and personal limitations

---

## The Connections Among Business Objectives, Problems, and Solutions

When firms cannot achieve business objectives these objectives become challenges.

Information systems often present solutions, partially or fully, to these challenges.

---

## How Information Systems Will Affect Business Careers

- Success in today’s job market requires a broad set of skills.
- Job candidates must have problem-solving skills as well as technical skills so that they can complete specific tasks.
- The service sector will account for 95 percent of the new jobs that are created or open up by 2022.
