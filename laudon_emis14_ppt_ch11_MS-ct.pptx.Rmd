  * Opportunities from new technology
* Solutions
  * IBM Watson Explorer
  * Machine learning
  * Natural language processing
* Illustrates how information systems improve decision making

---

## Business Value of Improved Decision Making

* Possible to measure value of improved decision making
* Decisions made at all levels of the firm
  * Some are common\, routine\, and numerous
  * Although value of improving any single decision may be small\, improving hundreds of thousands of “small” decisions adds up to large annual value for the business

---

## Table 11.1 Business Value of Enhanced Decision Making

---

## Types of Decisions

* Unstructured
  * Decision maker must provide judgment to solve problem
  * Novel\, important\, nonroutine
  * No well\-understood or agreed\-upon procedure for making them
* Structured
  * Repetitive and routine
  * Involve definite procedure for handling them so do not have to be treated as new
* Semi\-structured
  * Only part of problem has clear\-cut answer provided by accepted procedure
